### Introduction to Shrewdies Website Starter Purpose
I think it is easier to maintain a portfolio of websites if they have a similar structure. So I've created this Jekyll starter to give me the coomon features that I need in all my websites.
### Shrewdies Website Starter Purpose Audience
Shrewdies.netlify.com is written specifically for Keith Taylor. But it may be useful for anyone who wants to create static sites with Jekyll. Because it is easy to customise to your individual needs.
### Purpose of Shrewdies Website Starter
This starter site forms a template to maintain a common structure for all Shrewdies websites by Keith Taylor. So in practice, you must replace this text with a Statement of Purpose for your website. But for this website:
<div style="color:green;font-weight:bold">The Purpose of Shrewdies.netlify.com is to provide a starter kit for Keith Taylor's Jekyll-based websites. Also, it acts as a public resource for other website owners as long as they accept [the terms of this site](/about/terms-and-conditions).</div>
