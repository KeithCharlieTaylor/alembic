Telling your readers about your website is crucial to encouraging appropriate traffic to your website. Because it provides them with a foundation to help them understand why you are creating your website. Equally, a clear purpose supports the quality of your website and improves your quality score with search engines.

Note that this follows on from yesterday's [Install Shrewdies Site Starter](/general/2019/10/27/install-shrewdies-site-starter/). So it is important to start with the first post. Then continue day-by-day until your Shrewdies Site Starter is fully configured.

## Write All About It
It's easy to leave 'Admin' or 'Legal' pages until later. But that is wrong. Because they are vital to website quality. So make sure you give your website the foundation of a strong 'About' section.

Later, when you've finished the pages in this starter, you might want to add other pages. For example, RoadMap and/or History. Now those are great ideas to help your visitor understand your website. So add whatever you believe will help your visitors to get more out of your site. But always start with your Purpose page. Because that directs you whenever you add content to make sure it supports your purpose. Then quality assessors from Google can see exactly why you publish what you do.

So a strong, clear statement of purpose:
1. Helps you write better, focused, content.
1. Helps your readers understand what you're saying.
1. Helps search engines assess the quality of your content.

Therefore, take time now to edit ```/about/purpose/``` to match your purpose for your website. Then schedule time to review it. Because you should always review your Purpose page at least once a year. So the anniversary of starting your site is a good time for that. But also review more frequently when you make major changes. Especially during your first year.

## Your Website Purpose
Now you understand how important your Purpose Statement is, it's time for you to think about it clearly. Especially for business websites, it's a good idea to consult with your professional business advisors to make sure your intentions are decent, honest, and truthful. Most importantly, always write with your intended visitor at the front of your mind. Then you can get the right tone to match your target audience profile.

Remember, even personal websites need a Purpose statement. Because you need to be clear why you are creating your website. Then you will have less chance of feeling your time has been wasted as a result of random, disjointed content.

Next, I will continue with About pages. But don't move on until you've edited your Purpose page.
